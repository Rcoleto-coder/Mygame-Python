# Mygame-Python
This is my first attempt to create a simple in Python by using the Pygame library. 
<br> 
It is an exercise based on this tutorial: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
<br> 
(Work in progress)
<br> 
For now it only has:
  - One level
  - No boss
  - No sound effects, just background music.
<br>
Please feel free to contribute. Any advice is appreciated.
